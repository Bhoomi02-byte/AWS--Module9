Amazon S3

	  *Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a highly scalable, durable, and secure object storage service provided by AWS. 
	  *It enables you to store and retrieve virtually any amount of data—ranging from small text files to large media assets—from anywhere on the web.
	  *S3 serves as the backbone for data lakes, backup and recovery, content distribution, big data analytics, and static website hosting.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Buckets:-

	  *Definition: A bucket is the top‑level container in S3. All objects (files) reside in buckets.
	  *Uniqueness: Bucket names must be globally unique across all AWS accounts.
	  *Limits: By default, an AWS account can create up to 100 buckets (soft limit, can be increased upon request).
	  *Configuration: Each bucket can have its own region, versioning, encryption, logging, and lifecycle policies.


  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Objects:-

		*Definition: The individual files stored within buckets, comprised of:
		*Key: The unique identifier (including path) within the bucket.
		*Value: The data content itself (up to 5 TB per object).
		*Metadata: User‑provided or system‑generated name/value pairs.
		*Version ID: Assigned when versioning is enabled; otherwise a null version.
		*Tags: Key/value labels for cost allocation or management.

Storage Classes:-
    
	*S3 offers multiple storage classes to optimize cost for different access patterns:-

     ->Standard: General‑purpose, low‑latency, frequently accessed data.
     ->Intelligent‑Tiering: Automatically moves objects between access tiers based on usage patterns.
     ->Standard‑IA (Infrequent Access): Lower cost for less frequently accessed data; retrieval fee applies.
     ->One Zone‑IA: Like Standard‑IA but stored in a single Availability Zone—lower cost, less resilience.
     ->Glacier Instant/Deep/Deep Archive: Archival storage with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours at very low cost.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Access Control & Security:-
    
    *IAM Policies & Bucket Policies
       
	  ->IAM Policies: Attach to users, groups, or roles to grant or deny S3 actions (e.g., s3:PutObject, s3:GetObject) on resource ARNs.
      ->Bucket Policies: Resource‑based policies attached directly to a bucket, enabling cross‑account or public access controls.

    *Access Control Lists (ACLs)
       
	  ->Use Case: Legacy method for granting read/write permissions to individual AWS accounts or predefined groups (e.g., “AllUsers”).
      ->Recommendation: Prefer IAM and bucket policies for more granular, maintainable controls.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Versioning
     
	*Purpose: Protects against accidental deletes or overwrites by keeping multiple versions of an object.

  Behavior:

    *New uploads to the same key create new version IDs.
    *Deletions add a delete marker, preserving previous versions.
    *Can be suspended but not fully removed without deleting all versions.

Use Cases

   *Static Website Hosting
     ->Serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media directly from S3 with custom domains and SSL via Amazon CloudFront.

   *Data Lakes & Big Data Analytics
     ->Ingest and store massive volumes of structured and unstructured data; integrate with AWS Glue, Athena, and EMR.

   *Backup & Disaster Recovery
    ->Maintain on‑demand or scheduled backups; archive to Glacier for long‑term retention at minimal cost.

   *Application Media Storage
    ->Store user‑generated content (images, videos) with presigned URLs for secure, time‑limited uploads/downloads.
